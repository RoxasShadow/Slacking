Slacking. An app for lazy guys. An app for me. You give it a message, and it will share it everywhere.
Copy bin/config where you want, and copy its path in the 19th row of bin/slacking.
Then, build the gem, install it and edit the config file following these 
tips.

twitter tokens => http://dev.twitter.com/apps
	Create a new application (fill Name, Description, Website how you want, leave Callback URL blank);
	Accept the terms, compile captcha and create the application;
	In your application page, go to Settings tab and check Read and Write checkbox and update the new settings;
	In Details tab create new token clicking the button;
	Copy the relative tokens.
	
facebook tokens
	When Slacking gives you the link to Facebook, open it in a web browser;
	The URL of the page will be similar to "https://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html#access_token=LONGCODE";
	Paste LONGCODE in Slacking to send a post to Facebook;
	In order to not paste LONGCODE in each Slacking session, copy it in config file `facebook=>APP_CODE:LONGCODE` (you can leave default APP_CODE);
	If you have problems with the Facebook post sending in Slacking, LONGCODE can be expired: Repeat the procedure.
